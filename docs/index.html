<h5>The author of this project, Chloe Nguyen, is a big fan of American
football and was very excited upon discovering that JSC370 allowed her
the opporunity to unite her interests of football and data science. She
was particularly interested in the kicker position (and hence was
interested in investigating more on football field goals for the
project) because it is the only reasonable football position she can
potentially play- as a relatively small person who cannot throw or catch
a football. Chloe is a (bandwaggon) Bengals fan and is still devasted

<h1>THE ANALYSIS</h1>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In American football, two teams play to advance the football to the
opposing side’s end zone. Throughout the game, football coaches are
heavily involved in calling plays and directing their players through
the field.</p>
<p>Arguably the most reliable method of scoring points in football is by
kicking the ball through the crossbar. This is the job of a kicker-
whose only role in the game is to kick. Unlike many other positions-
such as wide receivers, where virtually every moment on the field is
different- a kicker’s game is one and the same. Because of that, kicks
are typically seen as “safe” methods to score and teams rely on kickers
to consistently make their shot. While kicking accounts for roughly a
third of all NFL scores, because it’s not considered as flashy in nature
as other football plays, kicking is an immensely underappreciated aspect
of the sport.</p>
<p>In this report, we will examine the factors that contribute to a
field goal kick. The question we are interested in exploring is: what
variables should football coaches focus on in determining whether a
field goal kick would be successful? In particular, what variables are
associated with the kicking length of a field goal and what is the
relationship between kicking length and kicking attempt outcome?</p>
<p>This project aims to help football coaches assess whether a field
goal kick would be successful at a certain game moment to help determine
their next game move.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the analysis, we need to go over common football
terminologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A field goal kick is considered ‘good’ or ‘successful’ if it
managed to score 3 points- that is, the kick went through the goal
post.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘starting yard line’ or line-of-scrimmage is the line at
which a play begins and the line at which the football is set for that
play.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>The Datasets</h3>
<p>The dataset we’re working with details all special team plays (that
is, plays that involve punts, kickoffs, field goals and extra points) in
all National Football League (NFL) games from 2018 to 2020. This dataset
was provided by the NFL as a part of their 2022 data competition, Big
Data Bowl: <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/overview"
class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/overview</a></p>
<p>We also refer to this dataset for the locations of NFL teams’ home
stadiums: <a
href="https://github.com/Sinbad311/CloudProject/blob/master/NFL%20Stadium%20Latitude%20and%20Longtitude.csv"
class="uri">https://github.com/Sinbad311/CloudProject/blob/master/NFL%20Stadium%20Latitude%20and%20Longtitude.csv</a></p>
<p>Additionally, we use this dataset for the abbreviations of NFl teams:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/cnizzardini/13d0a072adb35a0d5817"
class="uri">https://gist.github.com/cnizzardini/13d0a072adb35a0d5817</a></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-tools" class="section level3">
<h3>The Tools</h3>
<p>We’ll use dplyr to help merge all datasets and create new variables.
Additionally, we’ll use ggplot to create all static plots, plotly for
all interactive plots and leaflet for the map. We’ll also use broom to
tidy all raw outputs and to format all tables with kable. For loading in
the image and coordinating the points of the football field plots, we’ll
use jpeg and grid.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Wrangling</h3>
<p>First, we merge the data of team abbreviations with team locations
(longittude and lattitude) by teams. Note that there were NFL teams that
changed their name throughout the years- such as the Washington Football
Team who also went by the Washington Redskins. Hence, these names need
to be modified to match for the datasets to be properly merged.
Moreover, there were teams that recently moved to a different location
(e.g. Las Vegas Raiders) and thus, we need to update their location to
match their current state. We’ll use external sources to check the new
location of the team and input in this new value.</p>
<p>We then merge this dataset of team abbreviations and locations with
the games data set by home team abbreviation to get the location of
where each game was played. Once again, we have to fix team naming
conventions so that they match up in order to merge the datasets. Next,
we merge this new dataset with the game plays dataset by gameId. This
gives us the game information and location of each game play. Again, we
have to fix team naming conventions so that they match up in order to
merge the datasets. Note that in this analysis, we want to only examine
field goals, so we’ll filter for plays that are ‘Field Goal’.</p>
<p>Additionally, we merge this new dataset of field goal plays with a
dataset of players by kickerId to get more information on the athlete
who kicked the ball in each game play. However, before the merge, we
need to standardize entries in the players dataset. Since the entries of
height for this dataset are partially recorded in just inches and
partially recorded in both feet and inches, we convert all entries of
height to cm. We also convert all entries of weight to kg. Next, we
convert all birth dates to Date objects. For this variable, some entries
have the year listed first and some have the year listed last. To
standardize, we match date entries by regex to get the date formate in
order to convert them to Dates. For example, the regex “-[0-9]{4}$”
checks that the year is formatted first and hence, we are able to create
our Date object approporiately.</p>
<p>Now, we select the variables relevant to our question of interest:
season, week, gameDate, gameTimeEastern, longitude, latitude,
homeTeamAbbr, visitorTeamAbbr, quarter, down, specialTeamsPlayType,
specialTeamsResult, possessionTeam, yardlineNumber, gameClock,
kickLength, kickerId, height_cm, weight_kg, birthDate, displayName,
collegeName, Position.</p>
<p>With that, we created the following variables of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>birthYear: The year that the player kicking the ball was
born</p></li>
<li><p>age: The age of the player at the time of kick</p></li>
<li><p>specialTeamsSuccess: Whether or not the kick attempt was
classified as “good”</p></li>
<li><p>possessionTeamHome: Whether or not the team in posession of the
ball is the home team</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Exploring the Variables</h2>
<p>We first take a look at all the variables of the final dataset that
we are working with, their types, whether they are numerical or

<p>After that, we impute missing values for relevant variables. Note
that we use the mean for numerical values and the median for categorical
values.</p>
<p>The dataset is now ready to be explored.</p>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>First, we visualise kicking locations by viewing a plot of the
line-of-scrimmage of field goal attempts. From the plot we see that most
attempts were roughly from the 20 yard line. Additionally, we also
discover that the number of field goal attempts significantly dropped at
around the 40 yard line and further.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, we take a look at the proportion of successful kicks at various
line-of-scrimmage yard lines. We see that the success proportion was
quite consistent for attempts at roughly the 47 yard line and under.
However for field goal attempts over 47 yards, the success dropped
significantly. Most kicks at these yard lines were unsuccessful.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We then take an overview of each team’s field goal success rate by
the starting yard line. From the plot, we can see that the furthest
successful kick attempts in 2018-2020 were between the 45-50 yard line
and completed by the Dallas Cowboys (DAL) and the Carolina Panthers
(CAR). Additionally, while most teams that attempted close field goal
kicks (between the 0 to 5 yard line) scored 100% of their attempts, the
Miami Dolphins (MIA) and Philadelphia Eagles (PHI) were less successful.
The teams with the shortest max yard line successful kicks were the
Minesota Vikings (MIN) and the New England Patriots (NE). Both teams’s
furthest successful kick were between the 30-35 yard line.</p>

<p>From this, we investigate the field goal performance of each team by
average starting yard line in a season. In this plot, each dot size
corresponds to the number of field goal attempts made by each team in a
season. Notice that the most season field goal success rates were above
65%. Moreover, we see that the Tennessee Titans (TEN) were significantly
less successful in the 2019 season compared to all others NFL teams in
all season between 2018 to 2020. In 2019, their success rate was only
33.33% with 15 attempts. From external knowledge, the Tennessee Titan’s
main kicker was injured at this time and hence, was unable to play-
leading the team to go through four different kickers with evidently
little success. The best seasons for any team in terms of proportion of
successful field goal attempts had 100% success rate. These seasons are:
2020 Pittsburgh Steelers (PIT)- average yard line of 18.1 with 21
attempts, 2020 Green Bay Packers (GB)- average yard line of 22 with 15
attempts, and 2020 Seattle Seahawks (SEA)- average yard line of 22.9
with 20 attempts.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the summary table for kick length by special teams
results, we can see that the mean of a “no good” kick or an unsuccessful
kick (46.52 yards) was higher than that of a “good” kick or a successful
kick (36.70). Moreover, the overall minimum kicking length was 19 yards
and it was a successful kick; while the overall maximum kicking length
attempt was 67 yards and was unsuccessful. We also note that there was
only 1 downed kick and 1 out of bounds kick in all of the 2018-2020
seasons.</p>

<p>Next, we explore the kicking length by NFL teams in the 2018-2020
season. From the boxplot, the Denver Broncos (DEN) and Tennessee Titans
(TEN) had the highest average kicking lengths at roughly 42 yards. The
team with the lowest average kick length was the Las Vegas Raiders (LV)
at roughly 35 yards.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Moving on, we further examine the kick length of successful and
unsuccessful field goal attempts for every team. We see that the median
kicking length of every team is higher for successful kicks than for
unsuccessful kicks. Of the successful kicks, the Denver Broncos (DEN)
has the highest kick length median at roughly 40 yards. The lowest
median for successful kicks belongs to the Las Vegas Raiders (LV) at 33
yards.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>From examing the locations of the various team stadiums, we are
interested in determining whether there is a change in average kick
distance between plays in stadiums of high and low altitudes. In theory,
high altitudes allows for better football performance since air pressure
is lower and hence, the ball moves faster and straighter.</p>
<p>We use external resources to find the top 3 teams with stadiums at
the highest and lowest altitudes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highest altitudes: Denver Broncos (DEN), Arizona Cardinals (ARI),
Atlanta Falcons (ATL)</p></li>
<li><p>Lowest altitdues: New Orleans Saints (NO), New York Giants (NYG),
New York Jets (NYJ)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we’ll filter for two groups: one with kicks from the top 3
highest altitude stadiums and one with kicks from the top 3 lowest
altitude stadiums. Using a Mann–Whitney U test (otherwise known as a
Wilcoxon 2-sample t-test), we check if there was a significant
difference in kick lengths between these two independent groups.</p>

<p>With a p-value of 0.10, there is very weak evidence supporting the
alternative hypothesis that there is a significant difference in kick
lengths between kicks in high altitude stadiums and kicks in low
altitude stadiums.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On top of that, we are also interested in whether teams performed
better in terms of field goal success when they play home games vs. away
games. For home games, players would have familarity with the field-
seeing as that is where they usually practice. Additionally, morale
would be higher at home games since they would have their home crowd
cheering for them. This may help to boost their performance and hence,
increase their success with field goals.</p>
<p>We’ll use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to see if there was a
significance difference in proportions of successful kicks for teams
when playing home games vs. away games.</p>

<p>With a large p-value of 0.44, we cannot reject the null hypothesis
that there was no significant difference in proportion of successful
kicks between home games and away games. This result is not too
surprising seeing that the most important characteristic that NFL teams
look for when signing their kicker is consistency. Teams want kickers
who they can count on to score regardless of whether they are playing
home games or an away games since field goals are considered a “safe”
method of scoring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>To begin, we group our data of game plays by posessionTeam (the team
that is kicking the ball) and season. In the process, we summarise to
find: the proportion of successful kick attempts (success_prop), the
average height of the kicker (avg_height), the average weight of the
kicker (avg_weight), the average age at time of kick of the kicker
(avg_age), the proportion of these kicks that were done during a home
game (home_prop), the average kick length in yards (avg_kickLength).</p>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between kick length and successful
kicking attempts and to explore the association of other factors in a
successful kick, we’ll fit 2 models to this grouped data. The first
model is a multiple linear regression (MLR) model for success_prop with
predictors: avg_height, avg_weight, avg_age, home_prop and
avg_kickLength. The second model uses cubic regression spline and only
takes into account avg_kickLength.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="multiple-linear-regression-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Multiple Linear Regression Model</h4>
<p>From the summary, the p-value associated with average kick length is
0.000772 and hence, is statistically significant. From this, we have
very strong evidence that a 1 yard increase in kicking distance is
associated with an average decrease of -0.015% in season field goal kick
success proportion. This decrease in success may be due to loss of
accuracy when kicking longer lengths. Additionally, the intercept has a
p-value of statistically 0.002857 and is also signficant
significant.</p>
<p>With an adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value of
0.08246, approximately 8.246% of variation in season success proportion
could be explained by average height, average weight, average age,
proportion of home games played and average kick length.</p>

<h4>Model with Cubic Regression Spline</h4>
<p>In this model, kick length is our smooth term. The associated p-value
is 0.000321 and hence, is statistically significant. From the summary,
the effective degree of freedom is 5.188 and thus, the curve of kick
length is slightly more complex than a quintic curve. Moreover, the

significant.</p>
<p>With an adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value of
0.221, roughly 22.1% of the data fits the model with cubic regression
spline. This adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value is
higher than that of the MLR model. Hence, this model is a better fit for

<h3>Predicting</h3>
<p>Using ML, we attempt to predict whether or not a kick is successful
with the following variables: season, week, gameTimeEastern, longitude,
latitude, homeTeamAbbr, visitorTeamAbbr, quarter, down, posessionTeam,
gameClock, heigh_cm, weight_kg, age, posessionTeamHome</p>
<p>This section aims to help coaches assess the likeliness of a kick
being successful at a certain point during a football game. Hence the
predictor variables chosen are all variables that coaches would have
assess to during a game. Through the variable importance plots, we hope
to give coaches a better sense of what variables to pay attention to
when deciding whether or not a kick will be successful and hence, help
to determine whether or not coaches should call for field goal kick
plays.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="pruned-tree" class="section level4">
<h4>Pruned Tree</h4>
<p>The first model we’ll fit is a decision tree. We will prune this tree
so that it is not overly complicated. Note that the optimal complexity
parameter was the determined by looking for the minimum ‘xerror’. The
pruned tree splits on only a single variable, yardlineNumber. From this
tree, 34% of kicks starts at yard line 26 or more and have a success
probability of 66%. Additionally, 66% of kicks start at yard line less
than 26 and have a success probability of 99%.</p>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="bagging" class="section level4">
<h4>Bagging</h4>
<p>We then try a bagging model. From the variable importance plot,
yardlineNumber has the highest importance. This follows from the results
of our pruned tree- seeing that yardlineNumber was the only variable
that the tree had split on. This makes sense as the larger the yard line
number, the further away a kicker must start to kick the ball through
the goal post. Surprisingly, game clock is the second most important
variable. This may be because a big factor in kicking is performance
under pressure. The closer the clock is to the end of the quarter, the
more pressure there is for a team to score. While a kicker’s job is
under relatively similar conditions for most games, they may be under
different amounts of pressure depending on the team’s current stance.
This mental warfare may cause a kicker to perform unexpectedly.</p>

</div>
<div id="random-forest" class="section level4">
<h4>Random Forest</h4>
<p>Afterwards, we fit a random forest model. From the variance
importance plot, the variable that contributes most to the model’s
decision is yardlineNumber- followed by game clock. This echos the
variable importance of the pruned tree model and informs us that coaches
should take these variables into strong consideration in determining
whether or not a field goal kick would be successful.</p>

<h4>Comparing the ML Models</h4>
<p>With the models we fitted, we predict on the test data to determine
which model performs best. Comparing MSEs, we found that the random
forest model generalized best and the pruned tree model generalized
worst- however, all models were very close to each other. With that
said, the random forest was expected to perform better than the bagging
model since it randomly selects a subset of features and allows for
trees to be more independent of one another.</p>

<h2>Conclusions and Summary</h2>
<p>Examining whether elevation is a factor in kicking length, we
discovered through the Mann–Whitney U tes that there is weak evidence to
support a significant difference in kick lengths between kicks performed
in high altitude stadiums and kicks performed in low altitude stadiums.
We also saw through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test that there was no
significant difference in field goal success for team home games
vs. away games. Moreover, investigating the association between kick
lengths and kick outcomes, both models that we fitted suggests that an
increase in kick length is associated with a decrease in successful kick
attempts. This is consistent with our exploration- which suggests that
the average kick length for successful kicks is lower than the average
kick length for unsuccessful kicks. A possible explanation may be
because of the increasing lack of accuracy when it comes to kicking
longer lengths. Finally, in assessing whether or not a kick would be
successful, coaches should place most importance on the starting yard
line and also consider the game clock- as these variables were first and
second respectively in importance among our ML models.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>This report was limited to a relatively small sample size. While we
were only able to examine 3 years of NFL games, ideally the report
should be repeated with a dataset of field goal kicks for a decade of
NFL games. Moreover, the process of finding data on players beyond basic
characteristics such as age, weight and height was difficult. Being a
good kicker also relies on mental factors such as how well a player is
able to perform under pressure. However, these variables are difficult
to quantify and hence, difficult to retrieve data for.</p>
