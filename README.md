# JSC370 Final Project: A Look into NFL Field Goals in 2018-2020

This project was completed as a part of the final assignment of JSC370, Data Science II, at the University of Toronto. The project website can be found at: 

## The Project

This project provides an analysis on NFL field goal kicks of the 2018-2020 seasons. The aim of the project is to help football coaches  assess whether a field goal kick would be successful at a certain game moment to help determine their next game play.

## The Data

There are many ways to score in American football. A relatively reliable method to do so is by kicking a field goal. In this project, we'll visualize field goal kicks from the NFL 2018-2020 seasons through intactive plots.

This project works with data provided by the NFL's 2022 Big Data Bowl: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/overview

## Why Football Field Goals?

The author of this project, Chloe Nguyen, is a big fan of American football and was very excited upon discovering that JSC370 allowed her the opporunity to unite her interests of football and data science. She was particularly interested in the kicker position (and hence was interested in investigating more on football field goals for the project) because it is the only reasonable football position she can potentially play- as a relatively small person who cannot throw or catch a football. Chloe is a (bandwaggon) Bengals fan and is still devasted over their loss at the last Super Bowl.
